You are an intelligent scientist who has invented a prototype watch that allows you to travel 40 years into the future. You have exactly an hour and a half in the future day before your watch teleports you back home. In the mean time, you can do anything your heart desires, but use your time wisely!

You have successfully teleported into the future. Keep an eye on your watch at all times.

&quot;Whoa!!!&quot; you say. &quot;I guess this is what my laboratory will look like 40 years from now… How magnificent!&quot;

Into The Future
An Interactive Fiction by Tyler Makabe
Release 1 / Serial number 130313 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) SD

Lab Room
It is very gloomy in here with its spherical lights. You can vaguely see equpiment that you have in your very own lab room as well. The desks and chairs are covered in cob webs. The lab shelves are high up with shiny objects on the top. The walls are completely white with faded designs on them. An orange backpack is in here as well so that you can put all your findings into it and take them back home with you.

Aurora Walk
This seems to be the main walkway for many people. It is busy and lots of rubbish is littered on the ground. A trash can is always available yet no one has the decency to throw the trash into it. The ground is made up of a thick green cushiony pad.

Garage
This must be someone&apos;s garage. Definately not yours, that&apos;s for sure. Many intricate tools and devices hang from the walls and racks. A marvelous car is parked in the middle of it!

Such an incredible piece of work! The car is slick and skinny. A white coat of paint is layered on the whole car and you can even see your own reflection! A black trim goes all around the sides, with blue tinted windows.

Aurora Walk
This seems to be the main walkway for many people. It is busy and lots of rubbish is littered on the ground. A trash can is always available yet no one has the decency to throw the trash into it. The ground is made up of a thick green cushiony pad.

Garage
This must be someone&apos;s garage. Definately not yours, that&apos;s for sure. Many intricate tools and devices hang from the walls and racks. A marvelous car is parked in the middle of it!

Such an incredible piece of work! The car is slick and skinny. A white coat of paint is layered on the whole car and you can even see your own reflection! A black trim goes all around the sides, with blue tinted windows. Surprisingly there are no tires, and exhaust pipes stick out from the back of the car A fairly large bar code is inscribed on the trunk.

The prison cells are extremely small. The whole entire Lockdown contain chunks of the luminated steel that emerge from underneath the ground, and move guards toward each cell.

Stairway
Just an empty stairway. Wonder where this leads to.

Skyscraper 057
The largest building in the vicinity. Two steel doors open and close as you enter. The Skyscraper is filled with many people trying to buy and sell their products amongst many business owners.  Low square desks and pillows make up the whole floor. A young little girl is huddled in the corner as tears rush down her face. Where are her parents? How strange. 

You are about to drop dead of exhaustion. &quot;The cats will be the death of me,&quot; you always said.

Plaza Streets
People hustle and bustle around the plaza. A large fish fountain with a statue of a person is located in the center of it. The ground is tiled with black and blue cement around the plaza. What a sight.

You stumble to your knees and then collapse on the floor, quite surprised to find that the phrase &quot;drop dead of exhaustion&quot; can be literally true.

Pear Incorporation
This is surprising to see that Apple has a rival in their industry. Hundreds of devices are scattered on the wooden desks around the room. The Pear Inc. workers are ready to assist anyone that needs help.
