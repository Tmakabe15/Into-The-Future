You are an intelligent scientist who has invented a prototype watch that allows you to travel 40 years into the future. You have exactly an hour and a half in the future day before your watch teleports you back home. In the mean time, you can do anything your heart desires, but use your time wisely!

You have successfully teleported into the future. Keep an eye on your watch at all times.

&quot;Whoa!!!&quot; you say. &quot;I guess this is what my laboratory will look like 40 years from now… How magnificent!&quot; 
Make sure you remember to put significnt items inside your backpack to bring back with you later on.

Into The Future
An Interactive Fiction by Tyler Makabe
Release 1 / Serial number 130320 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) SD

Lab Room
It is very gloomy in here with its spherical lights. You can vaguely see equipment that you have in your very own lab room as well. The desks are covered in cob webs. The lab shelves are high up with a shiny object on the top. The walls are completely white with faded designs on them.
The outback dump is to the south, pristine library is to the east, garage to the west, and aurora walk is to the north.

This seems to be the main walkway for many people. It is busy and lots of rubbish is littered on the ground. A trash can is always available yet no one has the decency to throw the trash into it. The ground is made up of a thick green cushiony pad. Many of the pedestrians are walking by and minding their own buisiness.

Aurora Walk
This seems to be the main walkway for many people. It is busy and lots of rubbish is littered on the ground. A trash can is always available yet no one has the decency to throw the trash into it. The ground is made up of a thick green cushiony pad. Many of the pedestrians are walking by and minding their own buisiness.
The lab room is to the south, facial salon to the east, tech building to the west, and DNA beach to the north.

Aurora Walk
This seems to be the main walkway for many people. It is busy and lots of rubbish is littered on the ground. A trash can is always available yet no one has the decency to throw the trash into it. The ground is made up of a thick green cushiony pad. Many of the pedestrians are walking by and minding their own buisiness.
The lab room is to the south, facial salon to the east, tech building to the west, and DNA beach to the north.

Such an incredible piece of work! The car is slick and skinny. A white coat of paint is layered on the whole car and you can even see your own reflection! A black trim goes all around the sides, with blue tinted windows. Surprisingly there are no tires, and exhaust pipes stick out from the back of the car A fairly large bar code is inscribed on the trunk.

Cruising Shack
An open cabin made out of wooden planks. A cashier runs the whole place, while people go in and out, grabbing beach gear from the automatic moving beach shelf. Looks like you can just borrow the gear instead of paying.
The DNA Beach is to the west.

Sunny is leaning on the counter inside the Shack waiting for someone to ask for assistance.

Aurora Walk
This seems to be the main walkway for many people. It is busy and lots of rubbish is littered on the ground. A trash can is always available yet no one has the decency to throw the trash into it. The ground is made up of a thick green cushiony pad. Many of the pedestrians are walking by and minding their own buisiness.
The lab room is to the south, facial salon to the east, tech building to the west, and DNA beach to the north.

Such an incredible piece of work! The car is slick and skinny. A white coat of paint is layered on the whole car and you can even see your own reflection! A black trim goes all around the sides, with blue tinted windows. Surprisingly there are no tires, and exhaust pipes stick out from the back of the car A fairly large bar code is inscribed on the trunk.

Elevator Shaft
Yellow tape borders the edges of the elevator to the west. Near the elevator shaft are scissors probably left out by the workers. Seems as though the elevator is out of function and the workers are on their lunch break.

Garage
This must be someone&apos;s garage. Definately not yours, that&apos;s for sure. Many intricate tools and devices hang from the walls and racks. A marvelous car is parked in the middle of it!
The lab room is to the east, floating sidewalk to the west, tech building to the north, and obscure parking lot to the south.

Obscure Parking Lot
An eighteen foot parking structure that allows you to park your car whenever you want.
The garage is to the north, elevator shaft to the west, and skyscraper 057 to the east.

Elevator Shaft
Yellow tape borders the edges of the elevator to the west. Near the elevator shaft are scissors probably left out by the workers. Seems as though the elevator is out of function and the workers are on their lunch break.
The obscure parking lot is to the east, and directional path to the north.

You are now on cement again. The texture of this pathway is much different from the Floating Sidewalk.

Floating Sidewalk
A luminated clear pathway slowly elevates as you walk farther up onto it. Metal handbars line the edges of the clear floating path. It feels as if you&apos;re walking on a cloud, but looks like a beam of light!
The garage is to the east, the lockdown to the west, thrift shop to the north, and directional path to the south.

Thrift Shop
An old-school, yet reimaged look of a Thrift Shop. The racks of clothes and hangers automatically rotate once you are done looking at them. Most of the stuff here dates back to 2010. Looks fairly brand new and in style.

Aurora Walk
This seems to be the main walkway for many people. It is busy and lots of rubbish is littered on the ground. A trash can is always available yet no one has the decency to throw the trash into it. The ground is made up of a thick green cushiony pad. Many of the pedestrians are walking by and minding their own buisiness.
The lab room is to the south, facial salon to the east, tech building to the west, and DNA beach to the north.

Facial Salon
There is an aroma of strawberry that surrounds the salon. Lots of thin silk and hair is scattered all over the checker-board floor and tabletops. The fancy light blue lights gives the room a nice &quot;cool&quot; feeling to it. Silk seems to have been excreted from the tiny holes of the lights for some reason. White leather seats around the mirrors make up almost the entire salon.
The aurora walk is to the west, and pristine library to the south.
