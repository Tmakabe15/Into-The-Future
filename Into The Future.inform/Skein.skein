The Pristine Library
The library is embedded with silver crystals all around the walls. There are about ten different shelves that contain thousands of historic books that date back to your time. One of them is a black book that seems to be jutting out a little too far than the others though. A clear glass door is on the far side of the library along with a painting of a prestigious man.

Garage
This must be someone&apos;s garage. Definately not yours, that&apos;s for sure. Many intricate tools and devices hang from the walls and racks. A marvelous car is parked in the middle of it!

Such an incredible piece of work! The car is slick and skinny. A white coat of paint is layered on the whole car and you can even see your own reflection! A black trim goes all around the sides, with blue tinted windows. Surprisingly there are no tires, and exhaust pipes stick out from the back of the car A fairly large bar code is inscribed on the trunk.

Plaza Streets
People hustle and bustle around the plaza. A large fish fountain with a statue of a person is located in the center of it. The ground is tiled with black and blue cement around the plaza. What a sight.

Skyscraper 057
The largest building in the vicinity. Two steel doors open and close as you enter. The Skyscraper is filled with many people trying to buy and sell their products amongst many business owners.  Low square desks and pillows make up the whole floor. A young little girl is huddled in the corner as tears rush down her face. Where are her parents? How strange.

Garage
This must be someone&apos;s garage. Definately not yours, that&apos;s for sure. Many intricate tools and devices hang from the walls and racks. A marvelous car is parked in the middle of it!
The lab room is to the east, floating sidewalk to the west, tech building to the north, and obscure parking lot to the south.

Such an incredible piece of work! The car is slick and skinny. A white coat of paint is layered on the whole car and you can even see your own reflection! A black trim goes all around the sides, with blue tinted windows. Surprisingly there are no tires, and exhaust pipes stick out from the back of the car A fairly large bar code is inscribed on the trunk.

Aurora Walk
This seems to be the main walkway for many people. It is busy and lots of rubbish is littered on the ground. A trash can is always available yet no one has the decency to throw the trash into it. The ground is made up of a thick green cushiony pad. Many of the pedestrians are walking by and minding their own buisiness.
The lab room is to the south, facial salon to the east, tech building to the west, and DNA beach to the north.

40 minutes passed already. Wow! You haven&apos;t been checking your time lately.

An open cabin made out of wooden planks. A cashier runs the whole place, while people go in and out, grabbing beach gear from the automatic moving beach shelf. Looks like you can just borrow the gear instead of paying.

Such an incredible piece of work! The car is slick and skinny. A white coat of paint is layered on the whole car and you can even see your own reflection!

Skyscraper 057
The largest building in the vicinity. It is filled with many people trying to buy and sell their products amongst many business owners.  Low square desks and pillows make up the whole floor. You can go through the sliding door that leads to the top of the Skyscraper. A young little girl is huddled in the corner as tears rush down her face. Where are her parents? How strange.

Garage
This must be someone&apos;s garage. Definately not yours, that&apos;s for sure. Many intricate tools and devices hang from the walls and racks. A marvelous car is parked in the middle of it!
The lab room is to the east, floating sidewalk to the west, tech building to the north, and obscure parking lot to the south.

Such an incredible piece of work! The car is slick and skinny. A white coat of paint is layered on the whole car and you can even see your own reflection! A black trim goes all around the sides, with blue tinted windows. Surprisingly there are no tires, and exhaust pipes stick out from the back of the car A fairly large bar code is inscribed on the trunk.

It is very gloomy in here with its spherical lights. You can vaguely see equpiment that you have in your very own lab room as well. The desks and chairs are covered in cob webs. The lab shelves are high up with shiny objects on the top. The walls are completely white with faded designs on them.
The outback dump is to the south, pristine library is to the east, garage to the west, and aurora walk is to the north.

This seems to be the main walkway for many people. It is busy and lots of rubbish is littered on the ground. A trash can is always available yet no one has the decency to throw the trash into it. The ground is made up of a thick green cushiony pad. Many of the pedestrians are walking by and minding their own buisiness.
The lab room is to the south, facial salon to the east, tech building to the west, and DNA beach to the north.

A pretty beautician in the back of the counter is waiting to greet people as they walk through. The aroma of strawberry surrounds the salon. Lots of thin silk and hair is scattered all over the checker-board floor and tabletops. The fancy light blue lights gives the room a nice &quot;cool&quot; feeling to it. Silk seems to have been excreted from the tiny holes of the lights for some reason. White leather seats around the mirrors make up almost the entire salon.

Aurora Walk
This seems to be the main walkway for many people. It is busy and lots of rubbish is littered on the ground. A trash can is always available yet no one has the decency to throw the trash into it. The ground is made up of a thick green cushiony pad. Many of the pedestrians are walking by and minding their own buisiness.

Facial Salon
A pretty beautician in the back of the counter is waiting to greet people as they walk through. The aroma of strawberry surrounds the salon. Lots of thin silk and hair is scattered all over the checker-board floor and tabletops. The fancy light blue lights gives the room a nice &quot;cool&quot; feeling to it. Silk seems to have been excreted from the tiny holes of the lights for some reason. White leather seats around the mirrors make up almost the entire salon.

This must be someone&apos;s garage. Definately not yours, that&apos;s for sure. Many intricate tools and devices hang from the walls and racks. A marvelous car is parked in the middle of it!

Such an incredible piece of work! The car is slick and skinny. A white coat of paint is layered on the whole car and you can even see your own reflection! A black trim goes all around the sides, with blue tinted windows. Surprisingly there are no tires, and exhaust pipes stick out from the back of the car A fairly large bar code is inscribed on the trunk.

Facial Salon
A pretty beautician in the back of the counter is waiting to greet people as they walk through. The aroma of strawberry surrounds the salon. Lots of thin silk and hair is scattered all over the checker-board floor and tabletops. The fancy light blue lights gives the room a nice &quot;cool&quot; feeling to it. Silk seems to have been excreted from the tiny holes of the lights for some reason. White leather seats around the mirrors make up almost the entire salon.

Aurora Walk
This seems to be the main walkway for many people. It is busy and lots of rubbish is littered on the ground. A trash can is always available yet no one has the decency to throw the trash into it. The ground is made up of a thick green cushiony pad. Many of the pedestrians are walking by and minding their own buisiness.
