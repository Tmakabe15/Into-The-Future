You are an intelligent scientist who has invented a prototype watch that allows you to travel 40 years into the future. You have exactly an hour and a half in the future day before your watch teleports you back home. In the mean time, you can do anything your heart desires, but use your time wisely!

You have successfully teleported into the future. Keep an eye on your watch at all times.

&quot;Whoa!!!&quot; you say. &quot;I guess this is what my laboratory will look like 40 years from now… How magnificent!&quot;

The Pristine Library
The library is embedded with silver crystals all around the walls. There are about ten different shelves that contain thousands of historic books that date back to your time. One of them is a black book that seems to be jutting out a little too far than the others though. A clear glass door is on the far side of the library along with a painting of a prestigious man.

Garage
This must be someone&apos;s garage. Definately not yours, that&apos;s for sure. Many intricate tools and devices hang from the walls and racks. A marvelous car is parked in the middle of it!

Such an incredible piece of work! The car is slick and skinny. A white coat of paint is layered on the whole car and you can even see your own reflection! A black trim goes all around the sides, with blue tinted windows.

Plaza Streets
People hustle and bustle around the plaza. A large fish fountain with a statue of a person is located in the center of it. The ground is tiled with black and blue cement around the plaza. What a sight.

Skyscraper 057
The largest building in the vicinity. Two steel doors open and close as you enter. The Skyscraper is filled with many people trying to buy and sell their products amongst many business owners.  Low square desks and pillows make up the whole floor. A young little girl is huddled in the corner as tears rush down her face. Where are her parents? How strange.

Garage
This must be someone&apos;s garage. Definately not yours, that&apos;s for sure. Many intricate tools and devices hang from the walls and racks. A marvelous car is parked in the middle of it!

Such an incredible piece of work! The car is slick and skinny. A white coat of paint is layered on the whole car and you can even see your own reflection! A black trim goes all around the sides, with blue tinted windows. Surprisingly there are no tires, and exhaust pipes stick out from the back of the car A fairly large bar code is inscribed on the trunk.
