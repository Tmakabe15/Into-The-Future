You are an intelligent scientist who has invented a prototype watch that allows you to travel 40 years into the future. You have exactly an hour and a half in the future day before your watch teleports you back home. In the mean time, you can do anything your heart desires, but use your time wisely!

You have successfully teleported into the future. Keep an eye on your watch at all times.

&quot;Whoa!!!&quot; you say. &quot;I guess this is what my laboratory will look like 40 years from nowâ€¦ How magnificent!&quot;
