You are an intelligent scientist who has invented a prototype watch that allows you to travel 40 years into the future. You have exactly an hour and a half in the future day before your watch teleports you back home. In the mean time, you can do anything your heart desires, but use your time wisely!

You have successfully teleported into the future. Keep an eye on your watch at all times.

&quot;Whoa!!!&quot; you say. &quot;I guess this is what my laboratory will look like 40 years from now… How magnificent!&quot;

Into The Future
An Interactive Fiction by Tyler Makabe
Release 1 / Serial number 130306 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) SD

Lab Room
It is very gloomy in here with its spherical lights. You can vaguely see equpiment that you have in your very own lab room as well. The desks and chairs are covered in cob webs, with different flasks that contain unique chemicals inside them. The lab shelves are high up with shiny objects on the top. The walls are completely white with faded designs on them. An orange container is in here as well so that you can put all your findings into here and take them back home with you.

Pristine Library
The library is embedded with silver crystals all around the walls. There are about ten different shelves that contain thousands of historic books that date back to your time. One of them is a black book that seems to be jutting out a little too far than the others though. A clear glass door is on the far side of the library along with a painting of a prestigious man.

Garage
This must be someone&apos;s garage. Definately not yours, that&apos;s for sure. Many intricate tools and devices hang from the walls and racks. A marvelous car is parked in the middle of it!

Such an incredible piece of work! The car is slick and skinny. A white coat of paint is layered on the whole car and you can even see your own reflection! A black trim goes all around the sides, with blue tinted windows. Surprisingly there are no tires, and exhaust pipes stick out from the back of the car A fairly large bar code is inscribed on the trunk.

Lab Room
It is very gloomy in here with its spherical lights. You can vaguely see equpiment that you have in your very own lab room as well. The desks and chairs are covered in cob webs, with different flasks that contain unique chemicals inside them. The lab shelves are high up with shiny objects on the top. The walls are completely white with faded designs on them. An orange container is in here as well so that you can put all your findings into here and take them back home with you.

DNA Beach
Surfs-up! Seems as though everyone&apos;s at the beach today. A sign shows the reports of the day. Many blankets and umbrella-like equipment cover the bed of sand. A red box lies underneath the sign.

Lab Room
It is very gloomy in here with its spherical lights. You can vaguely see equpiment that you have in your very own lab room as well. The desks and chairs are covered in cob webs, with different flasks that contain unique chemicals inside them. The lab shelves are high up with shiny objects on the top. The walls are completely white with faded designs on them. An orange container is in here as well so that you can put all your findings into here and take them back home with you.

Garage
This must be someone&apos;s garage. Definately not yours, that&apos;s for sure. Many intricate tools and devices hang from the walls and racks. A marvelous car is parked in the middle of it!

Such an incredible piece of work! The car is slick and skinny. A white coat of paint is layered on the whole car and you can even see your own reflection! A black trim goes all around the sides, with blue tinted windows. Surprisingly there are no tires, and exhaust pipes stick out from the back of the car A fairly large bar code is inscribed on the trunk.

Pristine Library
The library is embedded with silver crystals all around the walls. There are about ten different shelves that contain thousands of historic books that date back to your time. One of them is a black book that seems to be jutting out a little too far than the others though. A clear glass door is on the far side of the library along with a painting of a prestigious man.
