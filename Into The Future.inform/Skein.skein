You are an intelligent scientist who has invented a prototype watch that allows you to travel 40 years into the future. You have exactly an hour and a half in the future day before your watch teleports you back home. In the mean time, you can do anything your heart desires, but use your time wisely!

You have successfully teleported into the future. Keep an eye on your watch at all times.

&quot;Whoa!!!&quot; you say. &quot;I guess this is what my laboratory will look like 40 years from nowâ€¦ How magnificent!&quot;

Lab Room
It is very gloomy in here with its spherical lights. You can vaguely see equpiment that you have in your very own lab room as well. The desks and chairs are covered in cob webs, with different flasks that contain unique chemicals inside them. The lab shelves are high up with shiny objects on the top. The walls are completely white with faded designs on them. An orange backpack is in here as well so that you can put all your findings into it and take them back home with you.

The Pristine Library
The library is embedded with silver crystals all around the walls. There are about ten different shelves that contain thousands of historic books that date back to your time. One of them is a black book that seems to be jutting out a little too far than the others though. A clear glass door is on the far side of the library along with a painting of a prestigious man.

Garage
This must be someone&apos;s garage. Definately not yours, that&apos;s for sure. Many intricate tools and devices hang from the walls and racks. A marvelous car is parked in the middle of it!

Skyscraper 057
The largest building in the vicinity. Two steel doors open and close as you enter. The Skyscraper is filled with many people trying to buy and sell their products amongst many business owners.  Low square desks and pillows make up the whole floor. A young little girl is huddled in the corner as tears rush down her face. Where are her parents? How strange.

Garage
This must be someone&apos;s garage. Definately not yours, that&apos;s for sure. Many intricate tools and devices hang from the walls and racks. A marvelous car is parked in the middle of it!

Such an incredible piece of work! The car is slick and skinny. A white coat of paint is layered on the whole car and you can even see your own reflection! A black trim goes all around the sides, with blue tinted windows. Surprisingly there are no tires, and exhaust pipes stick out from the back of the car A fairly large bar code is inscribed on the trunk.

Old Thirft Shop
An old-school yet reimaged look of a Thirft Shop. The racks of clothes and hangers automatically rotate once you are done looking at them. Most of the stuff here dates back to 2010. Looks fairly brand new and in style.

Floating Sidewalk
A luminated clear pathway slowly elevates as you walk farther up onto it. Metal handbars line the edges of the clear floating path. It feels as if you&apos;re walking on a cloud, but looks like a beam of light!

Garage
This must be someone&apos;s garage. Definately not yours, that&apos;s for sure. Many intricate tools and devices hang from the walls and racks. A marvelous car is parked in the middle of it!

Such an incredible piece of work! The car is slick and skinny. A white coat of paint is layered on the whole car and you can even see your own reflection! A black trim goes all around the sides, with blue tinted windows. Surprisingly there are no tires, and exhaust pipes stick out from the back of the car A fairly large bar code is inscribed on the trunk.

Lab Room
It is very gloomy in here with its spherical lights. You can vaguely see equpiment that you have in your very own lab room as well. The desks and chairs are covered in cob webs, with different flasks that contain unique chemicals inside them. The lab shelves are high up with shiny objects on the top. The walls are completely white with faded designs on them. An orange container is in here as well so that you can put all your findings into here and take them back home with you.
