You are an intelligent scientist who has invented a prototype watch that allows you to travel 40 years into the future. You have exactly an hour and a half in the future day before your watch teleports you back home. In the mean time, you can do anything your heart desires, but use your time wisely!

You have successfully teleported into the future. Keep an eye on your watch at all times.

&quot;Whoa!!!&quot; you say. &quot;I guess this is what my laboratory will look like 40 years from nowâ€¦ How magnificent!&quot;

Into The Future

Lab Room
It is very gloomy in here with its spherical lights. You can vaguely see equpiment that you have in your very own lab room as well. The desks and chairs are covered in cob webs. The lab shelves are high up with shiny objects on the top. The walls are completely white with faded designs on them. An orange backpack is in here as well so that you can put all your findings into it and take them back home with you.

It is very gloomy in here with its spherical lights. You can vaguely see equpiment that you have in your very own lab room as well. The desks and chairs are covered in cob webs.

Garage
This must be someone&apos;s garage. Definately not yours, that&apos;s for sure. Many intricate tools and devices hang from the walls and racks. A marvelous car is parked in the middle of it!

Such an incredible piece of work! The car is slick and skinny. A white coat of paint is layered on the whole car and you can even see your own reflection! A black trim goes all around the sides, with blue tinted windows. Surprisingly there are no tires, and exhaust pipes stick out from the back of the car A fairly large bar code is inscribed on the trunk.

Garage
This must be someone&apos;s garage. Definately not yours, that&apos;s for sure. Many intricate tools and devices hang from the walls and racks. A marvelous car is parked in the middle of it!

Such an incredible piece of work! The car is slick and skinny. A white coat of paint is layered on the whole car and you can even see your own reflection! A black trim goes all around the sides, with blue tinted windows. Surprisingly there are no tires, and exhaust pipes stick out from the back of the car A fairly large bar code is inscribed on the trunk.

It is very gloomy in here with its spherical lights. You can vaguely see equpiment that you have in your very own lab room as well. The desks and chairs are covered in cob webs. The lab shelves are high up with shiny objects on the top. The walls are completely white with faded designs on them. An orange backpack is in here as well so that you can put all your findings into it and take them back home with you.

You are out of timeâ€¦ Your watch has teleported you back to your very own lab with your orange backpack. Hopefully you managed to take enough stuff with you back home.

Garage
This must be someone&apos;s garage. Definately not yours, that&apos;s for sure. Many intricate tools and devices hang from the walls and racks. A marvelous car is parked in the middle of it!

Such an incredible piece of work! The car is slick and skinny. A white coat of paint is layered on the whole car and you can even see your own reflection! A black trim goes all around the sides, with blue tinted windows. Surprisingly there are no tires, and exhaust pipes stick out from the back of the car A fairly large bar code is inscribed on the trunk.

Skyscraper 057
The largest building in the vicinity. Two steel doors open and close as you enter. The Skyscraper is filled with many people trying to buy and sell their products amongst many business owners.  Low square desks and pillows make up the whole floor. A young little girl is huddled in the corner as tears rush down her face. Where are her parents? How strange.

Skyscraper View
What an amazing sight to see. Long metal poles stretch across the edges of the skyscraper for safety. There&apos;s a nice breeze at the top of the Skyscraper. You can see almost everything from here, how fantastic. Just don&apos;t look down.
