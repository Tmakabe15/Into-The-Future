You are an intelligent scientist who has invented a prototype watch that allows you to travel 40 years into the future. You have exactly an hour and a half in the future day before your watch teleports you back home. In the mean time, you can do anything your heart desires, but use your time wisely!

You have successfully teleported into the future. Keep an eye on your watch at all times.

&quot;Whoa!!!&quot; you say. &quot;I guess this is what my laboratory will look like 40 years from nowâ€¦ How magnificent!&quot;

Lab Room
It is very gloomy in here with its spherical lights. You can vaguely see equpiment that you have in your very own lab room as well. The desks and chairs are covered in cob webs, with different flasks that contain unique chemicals inside them. The lab shelves are high up with shiny objects on the top. The walls are completely white with faded designs on them. An orange container is in here as well so that you can put all your findings into here and take them back home with you.

Pristine Library
The library is embedded with silver crystals all around the walls. There are about ten different shelves that contain thousands of historic books that date back to your time. One of them seems to be jutting out a little too far than the others though. It&apos;s a black book with no words on its spine. A clear glass door is on the far side of the library along with a painting of a prestigious man.

People hustle and bustle around the plaza. A large fish fountain with a statue of a person is located in the center of it. The ground is tiled with black and blue cement around the plaza. What a sight.

Pear Incorporation
This is surprising to see that Apple has a rival in their industry. Hundreds of devices are scattered on the wooden desks around the room. The Pear Inc. workers are ready to assist anyone that needs help.

You stumble to your knees and then collapse on the floor, quite surprised to find that the phrase &quot;drop dead of exhaustion&quot; can be literally true.

The largest building in the vicinity. Two steel doors open and close as you enter. The Skyscraper is filled with many people trying to buy and sell their products amongst many business owners.

garage
This must be your garage. You notice all of your very own tools hanging from the walls. A fabulous car is parked in the middle of it. What an upgrade indeed!

Such an incredible piece of work! The car is slick and skinny. A white coat of paint is layered on the whole car and you can even see your own reflection! A black trim goes all around the sides, with blue tinted windows. Surprisingly there are no tires, and exhaust pipes stick out from the back of the car A fairly large bar code is inscribed on the trunk.
